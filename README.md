To use the Etch-A-Sketch program, you first enter in the X and Y coordinates. The Terminal will prompt you with these questions.

The program will then ask you a series of question like if you want to erase, more up, move down, move left, or move right. To quite the program at any time, enter 'Q'.

The program will ask you if you want to erase the screen. Entering 'Y' erases the screen. Entering 'N
' does not erase the screen.

The program will ask you if you want to move up, down, or neither. 'U' moves you up. 'D' moves you down. 'N' does neither.

The program will ask you if you want to move left, right, or neither. 'L' moves you left. 'R' moves you right. 'N' does neither.

The program will draw the map and it will repeat the same questions over again.
